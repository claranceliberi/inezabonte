## What is Stripe?

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a payment infrastructure that allows you to accept payments and send payouts. Its easiness of setting up is one of the factors that has made it a favorite among developers and even folks without any technical experience.

## About the Timeship

The [Timeship](https://timeship.codedays.co/) is a project that allows you to ‚ÄúTime Travel‚Äù. Pretty cool if you ask me üòå. The user enters a location, a year and the Timeship takes them there.

## Objective

Our task is to charge 50 dollars for every trip, that‚Äôs where Stripe comes in.

### Step 1: Setup your Stripe account

To use Stripe we need to create an account. The account will start in test mode (which is fine since it has everything we need).

### Step 2: Create a product

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/tizzertuna/image/upload/v1639849868/Screen_Shot_2021-12-16_at_11.37.51_iplv5q.png)

The product our customers will be paying for is the Timeship ticket. So, we add the product on Stripe with the price, mode of payment and other details.

### Step 3: Setup Stripe on the Timeship

Install Stripe using npm or yarn.

```bash
$ yarn add stripe
```

Get the Stripe secret key from the ‚ÄúAPI Keys‚Äù section on the dashboard and set it as `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in your .env.development file.

> The secret key should only be used server-side.

### Step 4: Create Stripe Checkout session

A checkout session is what the customer will see as they pay for their ticket through the Stripe checkout page we'll redirect them to. Below is a serverless function that accepts a POST request with customer details and returns a checkout url.

```js
// src/api/checkout-sessions.js

const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)

export default async handler(req, res){
//POST request handler
  if(req.method === "POST"){
    const { email, year, location, cancelUrl, successUrl } = req.body;

		try{
			const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
				success_url: successUrl,
				cancel_url: cancelUrl,
				payment_method_types: ["card"],
				line_items: [{ price: "your pricing api id here", quantity: 1 }],
				mode: "payment",
				customer_email: email,
				metadata: {
					email,
					year,
					location,
				},
        	});
        	return res.status(200).json({ url: session.url });
		} catch(error) {
			return res.status(error.status || 500).json({
            status: error.status || 500,
            message: error.message,
        	});
		}
	}
	return res.status(405).json({ message: "Bad request" });
}
```

- The `success_url` is the page stripe redirects to when payment is successful. If the user clicks on the ‚Äúback‚Äù button, stripe redirects them to the `cancel_url`
- `payment_method_types` specifies the method we would like customers to use to pay us.
- `line_items` lists items the customer wants to buy. In our case it‚Äôs just one time travel ticket. The `price` property is set to the `pricing api id` of the product we created earlier in step 2.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/tizzertuna/image/upload/v1639850028/pricing-id_lhcooz.png)

- `mode` has three enumerators: payment, setup and subscription. It‚Äôs currently set to `payment` since it‚Äôs a one time payment.
- `customer_email`, Its value will be used when the customer object is created. If not provided, the customer will be asked to enter their email on the checkout page.
- `metadata` extra details we may want to save about the transaction. In our case we are saving the email, year and location which will be helpful at a later point

Once a session is created, Stripe returns a url that we redirect our users to pay from. To test the Stripe checkout page we can use one the test cards Stripe provides; `4242 4242 4242 4242`
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/tizzertuna/image/upload/v1639850421/checkout_qdhsym.png)

### Step 5: Successful payment page

Once the payment is successful, Stripe redirects the user to the success url. Stripe will also append `session_id` as a query param.

Before we show the success message, we make a GET request to our serverless function with the session id in the params to confirm the payment status.

```js
// src/api/checkout-sessions.js
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)

export default async handler(req, res){
// POST request handler
...

//GET REQUEST HANDLER
	if(req.method === "GET"){
		const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(req.query.sessionId);
    	if (session.payment_status !== "paid") {
        throw new Error("You haven't paid for your ticket üëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö®");
    	}
   	res.status(200).json({
        message: `You travelled to ${session.metadata.location} in the year ${session.metadata.year}`,
    });

	}
}

```

### Step 6: Create webhook endpoint

This is the most important part because it determines whether you get to travel. Think of it as the ticket inspector üëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

First, let‚Äôs create an endpoint that Stripe will POST to immediately payment is complete.

```js
// src/api/webhook
import axios from "axios";
import createError from "http-errors";
const stripe = require("stripe")(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
	if (req.method === "POST") {
		try {
			//Check event type and payment status
			const { type, data } = req.body;
			if (type !== "checkout.session.completed") {
				throw createError(405, "Event type not allowed");
			}

			const stripeSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(
				data.object.id
			);
			if (stripeSession.payment_status !== "paid") {
				throw createError(402, "You haven't paid for your ticket üëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö®");
			}
		} catch (error) {
			return res.status(error.status).json({ message: error.message });
		}
	}
	return res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
}
```

The endpoint receives the `type` property in the body of the request which identifies the type of event. We specifically want the `checkout.session.completed` event. After confirming the type of event, using the `data.object.id` we can check the payment status.

To prevent tickets from being re-used, I save all completed session ids to a base on [airtable](https://airtable.com/) and use that to cross-check with the session id of the incoming request.

```js
// src/api/webhook
import axios from "axios";
import createError from 'http-errors'
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)


export default async function handler(req, res){
  if(req.method === "POST"){
    try{
      //Check event type and payment status
      ...

      //Check if ticket is being re-used üëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
      const travellers = await axios.get(
        `https://api.airtable.com/v0/${process.env.BASE_KEY}/users`,
        {
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`,
            },
        }
      );
      const records = travellers.data.records;
      const foundTicket = records.find((passenger) => passenger.fields.ticket === stripeSession.id);
      if(foundTicket) {
          throw createError(406,"This ticket has already been used" )
      }
    } catch(error){
        return res.status(error.status).json({message: error.message})
    }
  }
  return res.status(405).json({message: "Method not allowed"})
}
```

If a session id has made it this far then we add it to airtable alongside the metadata we sent to Stripe in Step 4.

```js
// src/api/webhook
import axios from "axios";
import createError from 'http-errors'
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)


export default async function handler(req, res){
  if(req.method === "POST"){
    try{

      //Check event type and payment status
      ...

      //Check if ticket is being re-used üëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
      ...

      //save travel details to airtable
      const currentTimestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
      await axios.post(
        `https://api.airtable.com/v0/${process.env.BASE_KEY}/users`,{
        records: [
          {
            fields: {
              email: stripeSession.metadata.email,
              year: parseInt(stripeSession.metadata.year),
              location: stripeSession.metadata.location,
              ticket: stripeSession.id,
              timestamp: currentTimestamp,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`,
        },
      });
    }catch(error){
      return res.status(error.status).json({message: error.message})
    }
  }
  return res.status(405).json({message: "Method not allowed"})
}
```

### Step 7: Setup webhook on Stripe

For Stripe to make requests to our endpoint we need to setup a webhook on the Stripe dashboard.

Head over to the [webhooks section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) and click on ‚ÄúAdd endpoint‚Äù. Start by installing the Stripe CLI to test the webhook locally. You can find the [installation guide here](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install).

Make sure to forward your events to the port your app is running on. For Gatsby we use port 8000 followed by the endpoint path.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/tizzertuna/image/upload/v1639850805/listen_lc423a.png)

With this set you can be able to test the webhook locally before deploying your application.

Once the application is deployed you can add the url of the endpoint to the `Add an endpoint` section. Make sure to select the `checkout.session.completed` event.

And with that you can now travel through space and time üöÄ.
