title: "About Me"
---

Hi there, I'm Ineza, welcome to my portfolio. This is my corner of
the internet where you get to see what I've been working on and
writing about.

I got into web development in 2020 just as the pandemic started.
With the help of sites like FreeCodeCamp and friends I met online
I slowly grew my skills in JavaScript. I later joined the Andela Technical
Leadership program where I learnt in demand skills like Nodejs, React, Express,
PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

After graduating from the program I have been focusing on Open source contributions
as well as learning JamStack frameworks like Next.js (which this site is built with) and also
Gatsby which I learnt from [Raae's Gatsby Mini Bootcamp](https://queen.raae.codes/).

In my free time you'll find me working on personal projects or reading books.
When the weather's right on a Saturday I sometimes go for a hike.
