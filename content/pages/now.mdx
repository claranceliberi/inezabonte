## What I'm currently working on

- I'm volunteering for [Develop for Good](https://developforgood.org/) on the [Climate Donor](https://developforgood.org/listing-item/website-redesign/) project.
I will be working with a remote team for about 10 to 14 weeks. 
- Finished adding navigation on the garden. I think might add SWR to keep the TIL page up to date.
- I'm also taking part in [Raae's Gatsby Mini Bootcamp](https://queen.raae.codes/gatsby-bootcamps/first-function/) which has been
a lot of fun so far. I'm working on adding payment with Stripe to my Gatsby Timeship ðŸš€
